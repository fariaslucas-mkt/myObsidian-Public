# myObsidian
Notes and knowledge base/network using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## About
This is a colletion of all my notes regarding my studies on AMC (Advertising and Marketing Communications), graphics design and related technologies. Everything from tipography to business management, from colours to entrepreneurship, from the legalities regarding this profession to web development. Basically everything I can use on my professional journey. Most of the text is written in Portuguese.
